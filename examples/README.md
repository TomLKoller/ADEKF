# Examples 

Here you will find certain examples to show the usage of the ADEKF.


Most examples will not load any sensefull data. Hence, to use the Code you have to load your own data into the correct objects.
All inputs will be marked with a leading \"__IN_\" so that you can detect them properly.

Examples are provided with cmake files. To compile them:
1. Create a directory build and change to that
  mkdir build
  cd build
1. Call cmake
  cmake ..
1. compile with make
  make
  
Or in short:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
